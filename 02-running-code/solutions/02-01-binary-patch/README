# Patching the existing bootloader

In this exercise we will download the EEPROM content from
GitHub, extract the logo image from the firmware, and
replace it with our own image!

## Downloading the EEPROM content

You can download the current EEPROM content from the
[Raspberry Pi Github](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/blob/master/firmware/stable/recovery.bin)

## Parsing the format

The firmware file is in a proprietary format, which we have described
in the [aside-eeprom](../../aside-eeprom.md).

# Task

- Take the `recovery.bin` file and extract the logo image from it.
- Create a new TGA file with your own logo (50 Ã— 64 pixels)
- Patch the EEPROM
- Flash to the RPi4
