# Initial research

- This isn't a class on how to write bootloaders for the Raspberry Pi,
  it's a class on bootstrapping yourself into being a bootloader or
  low level engineer!
- Learning how to learn! Learn how to figure out where to start.
- Understand the hardware

## Documentation

## What is the boot process of the Raspberry Pi 4?

- Common parts for ARM
- Documenation for x86\_64

## Getting output from the bootloader

- [Bootloader Configuration and Flashing](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-configuration)

## What is UART?

## How is UART handled on the Raspberry Pi 4?

## Figuring out the pinout and connecting a UART adapter

## Configuring the system to output to UART

## What is the existing bootloader doing?

## Making a code change
- Simple string change to prove we're having an effect

## Writing our own bootloader

### Planning our design
